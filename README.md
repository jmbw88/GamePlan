# Welcome to Gameplan!

## A MERN stack application to connect those with a love of games.

Game nights are great! Finding a game night, or planning your own, is less great.

GamePlan is designed to take the intimdiation, discomfort and frustration out of finding players to join you in your favorite game, and planning events around town.

## Find players, reach out, and make a plan!

Each user makes a brief profile,including listing some of thier favorite games to play. Then, when searching for those games, the players who've marked those as their favorite will appear for you to see! After that, send them a message!

Using our built-in messenger service, GamePlan users can chat ahead of time, building rapport and discussing their favorite things about the games they play; no player ever has to wander into a meet up of total strangers again!

Players who decide to plan their next game night can do so by creating a group on Gameplan, as well as an event, which wil appear on their personal calendar. 

## Improvements still to come

- Converting to an instant message format.
- Implementing invite system, to allow users to invite their friends into private groups and events.
- Continuing to grow the database of games for our users to enjoy.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
